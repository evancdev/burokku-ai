# Tetris AI

## Demo Script
The main idea of this demo release is to show a working environment of Tetris that can be used alongside with an agent. Further, we have also fleshed out a skeleton outline with docstrings for the DQN model that will be used for the game. Nelson will showcase the QNN and QNNAgent skeleton model as well and demonstrate parts of the Tetris codebase that can be used to provide feedback for said DQN agent. Evan will also demonstrate the Tetris environment to show working behavior of the game itself and showcase the implemented hueristic search algorithm to later on compare future effectiveness between RL model versus heuristic AI.
